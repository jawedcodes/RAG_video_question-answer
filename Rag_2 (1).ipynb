       "'I\\'ve heard that from a lot of women. But I think one of the big conversations that we miss in all of this are the long-term health ramifications that can come from that. When we talk about osteoporosis, one of the big silent killers of women, when we talk about heart disease, we talk about so many women dying from heart disease. It\\'s unbelievable when we look at those numbers. And then we talk about brain health. We talk about Alzheimer\\'s. More women are diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s than men are diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s. And so we have so much more research to do on all these things, but some of those are long-term health risks that we have to at least pay attention to. There have been studies that done that say, \"Wow, you have more hot flashes. There could be a correlation to your heart health. Pay attention to that.\" And I don\\'t think those are the conversations we\\'re having enough of. And we\\'re all learning as we go right now and trying to get as much information out there as we with it? like what\\'s happening when because I think sometimes when we talk about health we kind of talk about it in this silo of like here\\'s what\\'s happening chemically here\\'s what\\'s happening with the hormones but this is having real life impact >> is there any correlation between menopause and divorce break like talk to me about the the real life impact of it >> it\\'s such a good topic because it doesn\\'t just happen in the doctor\\'s office you could go to the doctor\\'s office and have the conversation but once you leave there you have to think about the whole 360 of it and it really is what I get excited to talk about because I think that we feel very lost during this time as women. We we\\'re in our career and maybe we\\'re hit with pmenopause and going into menopause and we could be showing up to work not being able to have a conversation. We don\\'t know how to how do you go into your boss and say, \"Hey, I might be in pmenopause for 7 years.\" I think that for a lot of women, they\\'re boss and say, \"Hey, I might be in pmenopause for 7 years.\" I think that for a lot of women, they\\'re starting to realize that we\\'re normalizing the conversation. We\\'re definitely not having the silence that we had before, but it can really impact you at work. It can show up in a lot of different ways. And what I\\'ve been fighting against is making sure that it doesn\\'t penalize women either. We don\\'t want that to hurt women. Women at this point are at the height of their careers. We want companies to retain women, hold on to women. They have some of the greatest wisdom they could ever have during these times and beyond. So, I think it\\'s really important for women to be able to get a hold and understand what\\'s going on so they\\'re not going through this journey just kind of blindly, which is what\\'s been happening. And then I think when it comes to relationships, it has a real impact. You know, we see a lot of divorces happening in the 40s. And I don\\'t think that that\\'s a coincidence. I'"

And I\\'m so grateful that you wrote this book, How to Menopause, that I highly recommend everyone gets. Uh, but thank you so much for being here. Truly, >> thank you. I\\'m so happy to be talking about this because it is so important for men to hear this conversation. >> Yeah. I mean, I want to start off by I I have a ton of questions for you and like usually when I interview someone, I have some understanding or some knowledge of the area. I have nothing, which is really great place for me to be in because I feel like it\\'s going to give a lot of people the opportunity to learn. And the first question I wanted to ask you is why is menopause still treated as such a taboo topic when it comes to everyday conversation and everyday life. >> It\\'s such a great question and I I think I have struggled with it for so long myself.',\n",
